# PDF Download Fix Verification Guide

This guide provides steps to verify that the PDF download functionality has been successfully fixed in the SMART_STUDENT application.

## 1. Automated Verification

Run the verification script to check if all necessary fixes are in place:

```bash
python /workspaces/SMART_STUDENT/verify_pdf_download_fixes.py
```

This script will:
- Check the directory structure
- Verify that code fixes are properly implemented
- Generate a test PDF file
- Provide instructions for manual testing

## 2. Testing with the Simple Test App

The simple test application allows you to test PDF generation and download functionality independently:

```bash
# Install any required dependencies if needed
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the test app
python -m reflex run simple_pdf_test.py
```

In the test app:
1. Click "Generate PDF" to create a test PDF
2. Click "Download PDF" to test the download functionality
3. Verify that the PDF downloads correctly

## 3. Testing in the Main Application

To test the full application:

```bash
# Run the main application
python -m reflex run
```

1. Navigate to the cuestionario section
2. Generate a questionnaire 
3. Click the download button
4. Verify that either a PDF downloads or an HTML file is provided as fallback

## 4. Verification Checklist

- [ ] Directory structure (assets/pdfs, .web/public/assets/pdfs) exists
- [ ] PDF generation works correctly
- [ ] PDF path resolution locates files in different directories
- [ ] PDF download functionality works in the application
- [ ] HTML fallback works when PDF cannot be found

## 5. Debug Output

To see debug output, check the terminal where the application is running. Look for lines starting with:
- "DEBUG: PDF URL obtenida de manera segura..."
- "DEBUG: Usando PDF ya generado..."
- "DEBUG: Archivo encontrado en..."

These logs will show how the application is resolving PDF paths and handling the download process.

## 6. Additional Information

For a complete description of all fixes implemented, see:
- `/workspaces/SMART_STUDENT/pdf_download_complete_fix_summary.md`

For more specific tests, you can also run:
- `python /workspaces/SMART_STUDENT/test_download_app.py` - Tests the download functionality in isolation
