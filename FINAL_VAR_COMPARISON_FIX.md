# Fix for AttributeError in Var Comparisons

## Problem Description

After fixing the VarAttributeError issues with `.get()` methods, another error was encountered:

```
AttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute '__name__'. Did you mean: '__ne__'?
```

This error was occurring due to an issue with how comparisons are handled in Reflex's Var system. The problem was in the `vista_pregunta_activa` function (and other areas) where comparisons like `EvaluationState.eval_score < 40` were used without proper parentheses.

## Solution

We fixed all instances of comparison operations on State variables by:

1. Adding proper parentheses around all comparisons involving `EvaluationState.eval_score`
2. Fixing malformed expressions like `((EvaluationState.eval_score < 4)0)` that had syntax errors
3. Using clearer range conditions with explicit boundaries for nested conditionals

For example:
```python
# Before:
EvaluationState.eval_score < 40, "var(--orange-9)"

# After:
(EvaluationState.eval_score < 40), "var(--orange-9)"
```

And for nested conditions:
```python
# Before:
rx.cond(
    EvaluationState.eval_score < 40, "var(--red-9)",
    rx.cond(
        EvaluationState.eval_score < 60, "var(--orange-9)",
        ...
    )
)

# After:
rx.cond(
    (EvaluationState.eval_score < 40), "var(--red-9)",
    rx.cond(
        (EvaluationState.eval_score >= 40) & (EvaluationState.eval_score < 60), "var(--orange-9)",
        ...
    )
)
```

## Testing

The application now successfully imports and initializes without errors related to State variable comparisons. Combined with the previous fixes for VarAttributeError, the app should now function correctly in production.

## Next Steps

- Deploy the fixed version to Railway
- Monitor for any remaining edge cases or issues
- Consider adding more type annotations to prevent similar issues in the future
